                    <p>A little white dress is nothing new for spring—but what is new is the way labels like Tove, The Row, and Ferragamo styled crisp cotton poplin (over pants with loafers or with XXL belts) 
                        to evoke that same easy, breezy sensation in in more modern form. You’ll find the same carefree vibe at Toteme, Cos, and Staud if you’re looking for something for everyday.</p>

                    <p>Pretty pastels and fun florals remain perennial spring favorites, but other trends are also making waves in women’s fashion this year. Theres a focus on transitional footwear, smart layering pieces and comfortable, flowy silhouettes.</p>

                    <p>Certainly not a trend for the minimalists, conspicuous and colorful stripes were especially prevalent throughout Resort 2023 collections. Ever one to show off his kaleidoscopic perspective, Christopher John Rogers led the charge with several striped looks in rainbow manifestations, while Chanel and DSquared2 showed their love for the print with vibrant knit tunics and graphic shirt dresses.</p>
